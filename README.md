A Modern Hybrid Headless CMS, highly modular content management system and web platform built with C# and .NET technologies. Designed with Modular architecture, extensible plugin support, and production-grade performance in mind, SharpPress provides developers with a flexible foundation for building everything from simple blogs and websites to complex enterprise web applications.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Plugin System** | Extensible plugin architecture for custom functionality |
| **C# Backend** | Built on modern .NET with ASP.NET Core |
| **Production Database** | MySQL support for enterprise-grade deployments |
| **Static File Serving** | Built-in caching for frequently accessed content |
| **Nginx Integration** | Ready for production deployment with reverse proxy configuration |

## 🧩 Plugin Development
SharpPress's plugin architecture allows you to extend functionality without modifying core code. Check out the SamplePlugin.cs file for a template:

```C#
public class TestPlugin : IPlugin
{
    public string Name => "TestPlugin";
    public string Version => "2.1.155";


    public Task OnLoadAsync(IPluginContext context)
    {
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task OnUpdateAsync(IPluginContext context)
    {
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task OnUnloadAsync()
    {
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture
### ⚙️ Core Components

- API Layer: RESTful endpoints with JSON serialization
- Plugin Engine: Dynamic loading and dependency management
- Data Access: Entity Framework Core with MySQL provider
- Caching System: Intelligent caching for static and dynamic content
- Authentication/Authorization: Extensible security layer

## 📜 Database Schema
### 🔍 Key Feature Details
- SharpPress uses a modular database design that expands with installed plugins.
- Automatically does the table creation and migration based on any C# model class.
- The class automatically maps C# objects to database rows (Object-Relational Mapping).

### 🔏 Security & Stability: It includes protections against some common risks:
- **DeleteWhere** requires a **WHERE** clause to prevent accidental full-table deletion.
- **ExecuteQuery** restricts potentially destructive commands (**DROP**, **DELETE**, etc.), allowing only **SELECT** queries.
- It uses a **ConcurrentDictionary** to cache the reflected properties of model classes, improving the performance of frequent operations.

### 💻 Technical Notes
- Dependency: SharpPress relies on the MySqlConnector library for all database connectivity so you MUST have MySQL on your server.
- Id Convention: It requires model classes to inheritance from FeatherData class, which is mapped to a primary BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT column.
- Connection Pooling: The connection string is configured with connection pooling enabled, which is good for web application performance.
